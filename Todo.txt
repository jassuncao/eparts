* Idea: Use an "attributes cloud" to select attributes for a part. Show the 5 most used attributes for that part category
* When a category with children categories is selected show all the parts that included in that set.
  See this for hints: http://www.ferdychristant.com/blog//articles/DOMM-7QJPM7

* Change the main parts interface. Don't use master detail. Show only a table with the parts and use a dialog to edit the part.
* For each line of the table include a way to easily edit the quantity of a part. A user probably won't spend a lot of time editing parts.
* When adding a part check if there is a similar part already. If so, ask the user if he wants to increase the quantity instead
* Add an option to quick add parts. It shows a dialog where the user choses the category and type and the input fields are changed accordingly
